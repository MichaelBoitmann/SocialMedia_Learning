# SocialMedia_Learning
Simple Cloning of Social Media

This is basically learning the social media flow using Django, bootstrap, and sqlite3.
Understanding the urls, views, models, forms, apps from main project to additional apps 
that will be created within the same project.

Granularizing the html files into many pages and connecting to the main page will be much
easier to update, correct and add things.
